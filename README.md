**TFS 1.8 Downgrade** brings the classic Tibia **8.60** protocol to a modern, optimized server engine, with native ClientID support and a large set of custom systems.

Developed and maintained by [Mateuzkl](https://github.com/Mateuzkl), based on [Nekiro's TFS 1.5 Downgrades](https://github.com/nekiro/TFS-1.5-Downgrades) and forked from [MillhioreBT's downgrade](https://github.com/MillhioreBT/forgottenserver-downgrade).

## ClientID Native

This source uses **ClientID everywhere**: items, maps, Lua scripts and database records all use the same IDs seen by the client.

| What changes | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Reads item definitions from the client `.dat` | Easier content editing |
| Removes ServerID/ClientID mapping | Fewer conversion bugs |
| OTBM maps use ClientID directly | Better compatibility with modern workflows |

Use the modified map editor:

## Optional Systems

Some custom systems are disabled by default in `config.lua` and `config.lua.dist`, keeping the server closer to classic 8.60 behavior.

```lua
forgeSystemEnabled = false
imbuementSystemEnabled = false
monkVocationEnabled = false
familiarSystemEnabled = false
```

| Config key | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `forgeSystemEnabled` | `false` | Forge tiers, commands, portal and item look text |
| `imbuementSystemEnabled` | `false` | Imbuements, scrolls, workbench, portal and item look text |
| `monkVocationEnabled` | `false` | Monk vocation behavior, outfits, spells and checks |
| `familiarSystemEnabled` | `false` | Familiar summons, spells and remaining-time look text |

Example:

```lua
forgeSystemEnabled = false
imbuementSystemEnabled = true
monkVocationEnabled = false
familiarSystemEnabled = false
```

## Compilation

### Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04

Requires **Boost 1.75+** and **Lua 5.5**.

Ubuntu 24.04 is recommended because it already ships the required Boost version. Lua 5.5 is installed manually below.

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  git wget cmake build-essential pkg-config \
  libmysqlclient-dev \
  libboost-system-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
  libboost-locale-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-json-dev \
  libpugixml-dev libfmt-dev libssl-dev libspdlog-dev libmimalloc-dev \
  libabsl-dev
```

Install Lua 5.5 manually:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf lua-5.5.0.tar.gz
cd lua-5.5.0

make linux
sudo make install

lua -v
```

If CMake cannot find the manually installed Lua, pass the paths explicitly:

```bash
-DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include \
-DLUA_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/liblua.a
```

Install `simdutf` manually on Linux:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf.git
cd simdutf
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
cmake --build build -- -j"$(nproc)"
cmake --install build
```

Build in Release mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mateuzkl/forgottenserver-downgrade-1.8-8.60
cd forgottenserver-downgrade-1.8-8.60

rm -rf build-release
mkdir build-release && cd build-release

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DDISABLE_STATS=1 \
      -DENABLE_SLOW_TASK_DETECTION=OFF \
      -DUSE_MIMALLOC=ON \
      ..

cmake --build . -- -j"$(nproc)"
```

| CMake flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` | Enables optimized release build |
| `-DDISABLE_STATS=1` | Removes runtime stats overhead |
| `-DENABLE_SLOW_TASK_DETECTION=OFF` | Removes per-task timing overhead |
| `-DUSE_MIMALLOC=ON` | Uses Microsoft's mimalloc allocator |

Optional Linux tuning:

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
sudo nice -n -10 ./tfs
```

### Windows

Install vcpkg:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
```

Build with **Visual Studio 2022** or newer. Choose backend, platform and build normally; dependencies are installed through vcpkg.
